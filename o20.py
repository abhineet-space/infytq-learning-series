'''Problem Statement
Coorg Fruit Farm is a retail chain which sells fruits grown in their orchards in Coorg, India.
They want to keep track of customers who buy fruits from them and also the billing process. Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.



Class Description:
Fruit Info class:

fruit_name_list: Static list which contains the list of fruits available
fruit_price_list: Static list which contains the price/kg of fruits
The above two lists have one-to-one correspondence, initialize it with the data given in the table
get_fruit_price(fruit_name): Accept a fruit name and return its price/kg. If fruit is not available, return -1
Fruit Name

Apple

Guava

Orange

Grape

Sweet Lime

Price per Kg

200

80

70

110

60

Purchase class:

Initialize static variable counter to 101
calculate_price(): Calculate and return total fruit price based on rules given below
For valid fruit name (hint: invoke get_fruit_price(fruit_name)),
Calculate price based on price/kg and quantity of the fruit purchased by the customer
If price/kg of the fruit is maximum among the fruits in fruit lists and quantity purchased is more than 1kg, apply 2% discount on calculated price
If price/kg of the fruit is minimum among the fruits in fruit lists and quantity purchased is 5kg or more, apply 5% discount on calculated price
If the customer is a "wholesale" customer, provide an additional 10% discount. Apply this discount on already discounted price, if any one of the above two points are applicable. Else apply it on calculated price
Auto-generate purchase id starting from 101 prefixed by “P”. Example – P101,P102 P103 etc.
Return final fruit price
Else, return -1.
Note:

Perform case sensitive string comparison 
There will be only one fruit with maximum price and one with minimum price

For testing:

Create objects of Customer and Purchase class
Invoke calculate_price() on Purchase object
Display the details'''

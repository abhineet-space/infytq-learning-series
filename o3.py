Identify the class name and attributes to represent vehicles. 

calculate_premium()
vehicle_cost
TwoWheeler
vehicle_type
vehicle_id
Vehicle
premium_amount
FourWheeler
premium_percentage
calculate_vehicle_cost()
__init__()
display_vehicle_details()
Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public
Include getter and setter methods for all instance variables
Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid
Perform case sensitive string comparison
Represent few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program."""

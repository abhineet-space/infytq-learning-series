'''Problem Statement
In the retail store scenario, let's look at the portion of customer purchasing items from the retail store.

         

Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.



Class Description: 
Bill class:

Initialize static variable counter to 1000
generate_bill_amount(item_quantity,items): Calculate bill amount based on the items purchased by the customer
Accept a dictionary, item_quantity which contains the item id (key) of the items purchased along with the quantity (value)
Accept a list, items which contains the list of Item objects available in the store
Generate bill id starting from 1001 prefixed by "B" and initialize attribute, bill_id. Ex. "B1001", "B1002" etc.
Calculate bill amount based on the quantity and price of the items purchased by the customer
Set attribute, bill_amount with the calculated bill amount
Assume that values in item_quantity and items are always valid. 
Customer class:

pays_bill(bill): Pay bill based on the bill amount

Accept Bill object which contains the details of the bill to be paid by the customer
Update attribute, payment_status to "Paid"
Display customer name, bill id and bill amount
Note: Perform case insensitive string comparison

For testing:

Create objects of Customer class, Item class and Bill class
Invoke generate_bill_amount(item_quantity,items) on Bill object by passing the dictionary containing item_id and quantity of items purchased by the Customer and list of Item objects
Invoke pays_bill() on Customer object by passing the Bill object'''
